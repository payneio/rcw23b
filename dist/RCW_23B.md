(2) The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions for shares that were entered into before incorporation, unless the subscription agreement specifies them. A call for payment by the board of directors must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.

(3) Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.

(5) A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to RCW [23B.06.210](#rcw23B.06.210).

(3) A good faith determination by the board of directors that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is adequate is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. When the board of directors has made such a determination and the corporation has received the consideration, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.

(4) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect to the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the benefits are received, or the note is paid. If the services are not performed, the benefits are not received, or the note is not paid, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be canceled in whole or part.

(5) Where it cannot be determined that outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable, there shall be a conclusive presumption that such shares are fully paid and nonassessable if the board of directors makes a good faith determination that there is no substantial evidence that the full consideration for such shares has not been paid.

(1) The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.

(2) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by RCW [23B.06.260](#rcw23B.06.260)(2). Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.

### <a name="rcw23B.06.300">RCW 23B.06.300</a>: Shareholders' preemptive rights.

(1) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, and subject to the limitations in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the shareholders of a corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.

(2) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a shareholder may waive the shareholder's preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by an executed record is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.

(3) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, there is no preemptive right with respect to:

(a) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, or its subsidiaries or affiliates;

(b) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, or its subsidiaries or affiliates;

(c) Shares issued pursuant to the corporation's initial plan of financing; and

(d) Shares sold otherwise than for money.

(4) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise:

(a) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class; and

(b) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.

(5) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.

(6) For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.



### <a name="rcw23B.06.310">RCW 23B.06.310</a>: Corporation's acquisition of its own shares.

(1) A corporation may acquire its own shares and shares so acquired constitute authorized but unissued shares.

(2) If the articles of incorporation prohibit the reissue of acquired shares, the number of authorized shares is reduced by the number of shares acquired, effective upon amendment of the articles of incorporation.

(3) The board of directors may adopt articles of amendment under this section without shareholder approval and deliver them to the secretary of state for filing. The articles must set forth:

(a) The name of the corporation;

(b) The reduction in the number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series; and

(c) The total number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series, remaining after reduction of the shares.



### <a name="rcw23B.06.400">RCW 23B.06.400</a>: Distributions to shareholders.

(1) A board of directors may approve and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (2) of this section.

(2) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:

(a) The corporation would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business; or

(b) The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

(3) For purposes of determinations under subsection (2) of this section:

(a) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (2) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances; and

(b) Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section.

(4) The effect of a distribution under subsection (2) of this section is measured:

(a) In the case of a distribution of indebtedness, the terms of which provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made; or

(b) In the case of any other distribution:

(i) If the distribution is by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the earlier of the date any money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;

(ii) If the distribution is of indebtedness other than that described in subsection (4) (a) and (b)(i) of this section, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and

(iii) In all other cases, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the distribution is approved if payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of approval, or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of approval.

(5) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent provided otherwise by agreement.

(6) In circumstances to which this section and related sections of this title are applicable, such provisions supersede the applicability of any other statutes of this state with respect to the legality of distributions.

(7) A transfer of the assets of a dissolved corporation to a trust or other successor entity of the type described in RCW [23B.14.030](#rcw23B.14.030)(4) constitutes a distribution subject to subsection (2) of this section only when and to the extent that the trust or successor entity distributes assets to shareholders.

(i) The corporate action is approved by all shareholders entitled to vote on the corporate action; or

(ii) The corporate action is approved by shareholders holding of record or otherwise entitled to vote in the aggregate not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to approve such corporate action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the corporate action were present and voted, and at the time the corporate action is approved the corporation is not a public company and is authorized to approve such corporate action under this subsection (1)(a)(ii) by a general or limited authorization contained in its articles of incorporation.

(b) Corporate action may be approved by shareholders without a meeting or a vote by means of execution of a single consent or multiple counterpart consents by shareholders holding of record or otherwise entitled to vote in the aggregate not less than the minimum number of votes necessary under (a)(i) or (ii) of this subsection. Any such shareholder consent must: (i) Be in the form of an executed record; (ii) indicate the date of execution of the consent by each shareholder who executes it, which date must be on or after the applicable record date determined in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; (iii) describe the corporate action being approved; (iv) when delivered to each shareholder for execution, include or be accompanied by the same material that would have been required by this title to be delivered to shareholders in or accompanying a notice of meeting at which the proposed corporate action would have been submitted for shareholder approval; and (v) be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. A shareholder may withdraw an executed shareholder consent by delivering a notice of withdrawal in the form of an executed record to the corporation prior to the time when shareholder consents sufficient to approve the corporate action have been delivered to the corporation.

(2) The record date for determining shareholders entitled to approve a corporate action without a meeting may be fixed under RCW [23B.07.030](#rcw23B.07.030) or [23B.07.070](#rcw23B.07.070), but if not so fixed shall be the date of execution indicated on the earliest dated shareholder consent executed under subsection (1) of this section, even though such shareholder consent may not have been delivered to the corporation on that date.

(3)(a) Notice that shareholder consents are being sought under subsection (1)(a) of this section shall be given, by the corporation or by another person soliciting such consents, on or promptly after the record date, to all shareholders entitled to vote on the record date who have not yet executed the shareholder consent and, if this title would otherwise require that notice of a meeting of shareholders to consider the proposed corporate action be given to nonvoting shareholders, to all nonvoting shareholders as of the record date. Notice given under this subsection (3)(a) shall include or be accompanied by the same information required to be included in or to accompany the shareholder consent under subsection (1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of this section.

(b) Notice that sufficient shareholder consents have been executed to approve the proposed corporate action under either of subsection (1)(a)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be given by the corporation, promptly after delivery to the corporation of shareholder consents sufficient to approve the corporate action in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, to all shareholders entitled to vote on the record date and, if this title would otherwise require that notice of a meeting of shareholders to consider the proposed corporate action be given to nonvoting shareholders, to all nonvoting shareholders as of the record date.

(5) Approval of corporate action by execution of shareholder consents under this section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any record, except that, if the corporate action requires the filing of a certificate under any other section of this title, the certificate so filed shall state, in lieu of any statement required by that section concerning any vote of shareholders, that shareholder approval has been obtained in accordance with this section and that notice to any nonconsenting shareholders has been given to the extent required by this section.

If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under RCW [23B.07.070](#rcw23B.07.070), however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given under this section to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.060">RCW 23B.07.060</a>: Waiver of notice.

(1) A shareholder may waive any notice required by this title, the articles of incorporation, or bylaws before or after the date and time of the meeting that is the subject of such notice, or in the case of notice required by RCW [23B.07.040](#rcw23B.07.040)(3), before or after the corporate action to be approved by executed consent becomes effective. Except as provided by subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the waiver must be delivered by the shareholder entitled to notice to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records, which waiver shall be set forth either (a) in an executed and dated record or (b) if the corporation has designated an address, location, or system to which the waiver may be electronically transmitted and the waiver is electronically transmitted to the designated address, location, or system, in an executed and dated electronically transmitted record.

(2) A shareholder's attendance at a meeting waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting.

(3) A shareholder waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at a meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.070">RCW 23B.07.070</a>: Record date.

(1) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date for one or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote, or to approve any other corporate action. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors of the corporation may fix a future date as the record date.

(2) If not otherwise fixed under subsection (1) of this section or RCW [23B.07.030](#rcw23B.07.030), the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders' meeting is the day before the first notice is delivered to shareholders.

(3) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the share dividend.

(4) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.

(5) A record date fixed under this section may not be more than seventy days before the meeting of shareholders or more than ten days prior to the date on which the first shareholder consent is executed under RCW [23B.07.040](#rcw23B.07.040)(1)(b).

(6) A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders' meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed for the original meeting.

(7) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it may provide that the original record date continues in effect or it may fix a new record date.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.080">RCW 23B.07.080</a>: Shareholder participation by means of communication equipment.

If the articles of incorporation or bylaws so provide, shareholders may participate in any meeting of shareholders by any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting. A shareholder participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.200">RCW 23B.07.200</a>: Shareholders' list for meeting.

(1) After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders on the record date who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list must be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.

(2) The shareholders' list must be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning ten days prior to the meeting and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney is entitled to inspect the list, during regular business hours and at the shareholder's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.

(3) The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.

(4) If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney to inspect the shareholders' list before or at the meeting, the superior court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection is complete.

(5) A shareholder's right to copy the shareholders' list, and a shareholder's right to otherwise inspect and copy the record of shareholders, is governed by RCW [23B.16.020](#rcw23B.16.020)(3).

(6) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list does not affect the validity of corporate action approved at the meeting.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.210">RCW 23B.07.210</a>: Voting entitlement of shares.

(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section or unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders' meeting. Only shares are entitled to vote.

(2) The shares of a corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by a second corporation, domestic or foreign, and the first corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for directors of the second corporation.

(3) Subsection (2) of this section does not limit the power of a corporation to vote any shares, including its own shares, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.220">RCW 23B.07.220</a>: Proxies.

(1) A shareholder may vote the shareholder's shares in person or by proxy.

(2) A shareholder or the shareholder's agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by:

(a) Executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the shareholder or the shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or

(b) Authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a recorded telephone call, voice mail, or other electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission, provided that the transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information, including any security or validation controls used, from which it can reasonably be determined that the transmission was authorized by the shareholder. If it is determined that the transmission is valid, the inspectors of election or, if there are no inspectors, any officer or agent of the corporation making that determination on behalf of the corporation shall specify the information upon which they relied. The corporation shall require the holders of proxies received by transmission to provide to the corporation copies of the transmission and the corporation shall retain copies of the transmission for a reasonable period of time after the election provided that they are retained for at least sixty days.

(3) An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or telegram, cablegram, recorded telephone call, voice mail, or other transmission of the appointment is received by the inspectors of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment.

(4) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment indicates that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of:

(a) A pledgee;

(b) A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares;

(c) A creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms requiring the appointment;

(d) An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or

(e) A party to a voting agreement created under RCW [23B.07.310](#rcw23B.07.310).

### <a name="rcw23B.07.250">RCW 23B.07.250</a>: Quorum and voting requirements.

(1) Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may approve a corporate action at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that corporate action.

(2) Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting other than solely to object to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.

(3) If a quorum exists, a corporate action, other than the election of directors, is approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the corporate action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the corporate action, unless the articles of incorporation or this title require a greater number of affirmative votes.

(4) An amendment of articles of incorporation adding, changing, or deleting either (i) [(a)] a quorum for a voting group greater or lesser than specified in subsection (1) of this section, or (ii) [(b)] a voting requirement for a voting group greater than specified in subsection (3) of this section, is governed by RCW [23B.07.270](#rcw23B.07.270).

(1) If the articles of incorporation or this title provide for voting on a corporate action by all shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single voting group and do not provide for separate voting by any other voting group or groups with respect to that corporate action, that corporate action is approved when voted upon by that single voting group as provided in RCW [23B.07.250](#rcw23B.07.250).

(2) If the articles of incorporation or this title provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a corporate action, that corporate action is approved only when voted upon by each of those voting groups as provided in RCW [23B.07.250](#rcw23B.07.250).

(4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, an amendment to the articles of incorporation that adds, changes, or deletes a greater or lesser quorum or voting requirement for a particular corporate action must meet the same quorum requirement and be adopted by the same vote and voting groups as are required under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect for approval of the corporate action.

(5) An amendment to the articles of incorporation that adds, changes, or deletes a greater or lesser quorum or voting requirement for a merger, share exchange, sale of substantially all assets, or dissolution must be adopted by the same vote and voting groups as are required under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect for approval of the particular corporate action, or the quorum and voting requirements then in effect for amendments to articles of incorporation, whichever is greater.

(2) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or in a bylaw adopted under RCW [23B.10.205](#rcw23B.10.205), in any election of directors the candidates elected are those receiving the largest numbers of votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election, up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares.

An extension is valid only until the earlier of ten years from the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement or the date of expiration of the extension. The voting trustee must deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation's principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.310">RCW 23B.07.310</a>: Voting agreements.

(1) Two or more shareholders may provide for the manner in which they will vote their shares by signing an agreement for that purpose. A voting agreement created under this section is not subject to the provisions of RCW [23B.07.300](#rcw23B.07.300).

(3) The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by RCW [23B.06.260](#rcw23B.06.260)(2). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Unless the agreement provides otherwise, any person who acquires outstanding or newly issued shares in the corporation after an agreement authorized by this section has been effected, whether by purchase, gift, operation of law, or otherwise, is deemed to have assented to the agreement and to be a party to the agreement. A purchaser of shares who is aggrieved because he or she at the time of purchase did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of the agreement may either: (a) Bring an action to rescind the purchase within the earlier of ninety days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or two years after the purchase of the shares; or (b) continue to hold the shares subject to the agreement but with a right of action for any damages resulting from nondisclosure of the existence of the agreement. A purchaser shall be deemed to have constructive knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares.

(6) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

(7) Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.



### <a name="rcw23B.07.400">RCW 23B.07.400</a>: Derivative proceedings procedure.

(2) A complaint in a proceeding brought in the right of a corporation must be verified and allege with particularity the demand made, if any, to obtain action by the board of directors and either that the demand was refused or ignored or why a demand was not made. Whether or not a demand for action was made, if the corporation commences an investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint, the court may stay any proceeding until the investigation is completed.

(3) A proceeding commenced under this section may not be discontinued or settled without the court's approval. If the court determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially affect the interest of the corporation's shareholders or a class of shareholders, the court shall direct that notice be given to the shareholders affected.

(4) On termination of the proceeding the court may require the plaintiff to pay any defendant's reasonable expenses, including counsel fees, incurred in defending the proceeding if it finds that the proceeding was commenced without reasonable cause.

### <a name="rcw23B.08.060">RCW 23B.08.060</a>: Staggered terms for directors.

(1) The articles of incorporation may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two or three groups, with each group containing one-half or one-third of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders' meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders' meeting after their election, and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders' meeting after their election. At each annual shareholders' meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two years or three years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

(2) If cumulative voting is authorized, any provision establishing staggered terms of directors shall provide that at least three directors shall be elected at each annual shareholders' meeting.

(2) A notice of resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date, or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. A notice of resignation that is conditioned upon failing to receive a specified vote for election as a director may provide that it is irrevocable.



### <a name="rcw23B.08.080">RCW 23B.08.080</a>: Removal of directors by shareholders.

(1) The shareholders may remove one or more directors with or without cause unless the articles of incorporation provide that directors may be removed only for cause.

(2) If a director is elected by holders of one or more authorized classes or series of shares, only the holders of those classes or series of shares may participate in the vote to remove the director.

(3) If cumulative voting is authorized, and if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director's removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove the director.

(4) A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a special meeting called for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director.



### <a name="rcw23B.08.090">RCW 23B.08.090</a>: Removal of directors by judicial proceeding.

(1) The superior court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located may remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding commenced either by the corporation or by its shareholders holding at least ten percent of the outstanding shares of any class if the court finds that (a) the director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct with respect to the corporation, and (b) removal is in the best interest of the corporation.

(2) The court that removes a director may bar the director from reelection for a period prescribed by the court.

(3) If shareholders commence a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, they shall make the corporation a party defendant.

(1) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, if a vacancy occurs on a board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors:

(1) Directors' action respecting a transaction is effective for purposes of RCW [23B.08.710](#rcw23B.08.710)(2)(a) if the transaction received the affirmative vote of a majority, but no fewer than two, of those qualified directors on the board of directors or on a duly empowered committee of the board who voted on the transaction after either required disclosure to them, to the extent the information was not known by them, or compliance with subsection (2) of this section, provided that action by a committee is so effective only if:

(a) All its members are qualified directors; and

(b) Its members are either all the qualified directors on the board or are appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors on the board.

(2) If a director has a conflicting interest respecting a transaction, but neither the director nor a related person of the director specified in RCW [23B.08.700](#rcw23B.08.700)(3)(a) is a party to the transaction, and if the director has a duty under law or professional canon, or a duty of confidentiality to another person, respecting information relating to the transaction such that the director may not make the disclosure described in RCW [23B.08.700](#rcw23B.08.700)(4)(b), then disclosure is sufficient for purposes of subsection (1) of this section if the director (a) discloses to the directors voting on the transaction the existence and nature of the director's conflicting interest and informs them of the character and limitations imposed by that duty before their vote on the transaction, and (b) plays no part, directly or indirectly, in their deliberations or vote.

(3) A majority, but no fewer than two, of all the qualified directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section. Directors' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence or vote of a director who is not a qualified director.

(4) For purposes of this section "qualified director" means, with respect to a director's conflicting interest transaction, any director who does not have either (a) a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, or (b) a familial, financial, professional, or employment relationship with a second director who does have a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, which relationship would, in the circumstances, reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the first director's judgment when voting on the transaction.



### <a name="rcw23B.08.730">RCW 23B.08.730</a>: Shareholders' action.

(1) Shareholders' action respecting a transaction is effective for purposes of RCW [23B.08.710](#rcw23B.08.710)(2)(b) if a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares were cast in favor of the transaction after (a) notice to shareholders describing the director's conflicting interest transaction, (b) provision of the information referred to in subsection (4) of this section, and (c) required disclosure to the shareholders who voted on the transaction, to the extent the information was not known by them.

(2) For purposes of this section, "qualified shares" means any shares entitled to vote with respect to the director's conflicting interest transaction except shares that, to the knowledge, before the vote, of the secretary, or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, are beneficially owned, or the voting of which is controlled, by a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction or by a related person of the director, or both.

(3) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.

(4) For purposes of compliance with subsection (1) of this section, a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary, or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, of the number, and the identity of persons holding or controlling the vote, of all shares that the director knows are beneficially owned, or the voting of which is controlled, by the director, or by a related person of the director, or both.

(5) If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection (1) of this section solely because of a failure of a director to comply with subsection (4) of this section, and if the director establishes that the director's failure did not determine and was not intended by the director to influence the outcome of the vote, the court may, with or without further proceedings respecting RCW [23B.08.710](#rcw23B.08.710)(2)(c), take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and give such effect, if any, to the shareholders' vote, as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.

### <a name="rcw23B.09.030">RCW 23B.09.030</a>: Approval of a plan of entity conversion.

In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to an other entity:

(1) The plan of entity conversion must be adopted by the board of directors of the converting entity and the shareholders entitled to vote must approve the plan.

(2) After adopting a plan of entity conversion, the board of directors of the converting entity must submit the plan of entity conversion for approval by its shareholders.

(3) The board of directors must recommend the plan of entity conversion to the shareholders, unless (a) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation; or (b) RCW [23B.08.245](#rcw23B.08.245) applies, and in either case the board of directors communicates the basis for so proceeding to the shareholders.

(4) The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of entity conversion on any basis, including the affirmative vote of holders of a specified percentage of shares held by any group of shareholders not otherwise entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the plan of entity conversion.

(5) In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to a foreign corporation, in addition to any other voting conditions imposed by the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, approval of the plan of entity conversion requires the affirmative vote of shareholders that would be required to approve a plan of merger under RCW [23B.11.030](#rcw23B.11.030), and of each other voting group entitled under RCW [23B.11.035](#rcw23B.11.035) or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on a plan of merger. Separate voting by additional voting groups is required on a plan of entity conversion if such voting group or groups would be entitled to vote on a plan of merger under the circumstances described in RCW [23B.11.035](#rcw23B.11.035). The articles of incorporation may require a greater or lesser vote to approve a plan of entity conversion than that provided in this subsection, or a greater or lesser vote by separate voting groups, so long as the required vote is not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan of entity conversion and of each other voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan.

(6) In the case of an entity conversion of a domestic corporation to an other entity that is not a foreign corporation, approval of the plan of entity conversion requires the approval of all shareholders of the domestic corporation, whether or not entitled to vote under this title or the articles of incorporation.

(7) If as a result of the conversion one or more shareholders of the domestic corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, in addition to the approval requirements under subsections (5) and (6) of this section, approval of the plan of entity conversion must also require each such shareholder to execute a separate record consenting to become subject to such owner liability.

(8) If the approval of the shareholders is to be given at a meeting, the domestic corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed meeting of shareholders at which the plan of entity conversion is to be submitted for approval in accordance with RCW [23B.07.050](#rcw23B.07.050).

(9) If any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement to which any of the directors or shareholders of the domestic corporation are parties, adopted, or entered into before June 12, 2014, applies to a merger of the domestic corporation, other than a provision that limits or eliminates voting or dissenters' rights, and the document does not refer to an entity conversion of the domestic corporation, the provision is deemed to apply to an entity conversion of the domestic corporation until the provision is subsequently amended.

(c) Change the rights, preferences, or limitations of all or part of the issued and outstanding shares of the class or series, thereby adversely affecting the holders of shares of the class or series;

(d) Change all or part of the issued and outstanding shares of the class or series into a different number of shares of the same class or series, thereby adversely affecting the holders of shares of the class or series;

(e) Create a new class or series of shares having rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution that are, or upon designation by the board of directors in accordance with RCW [23B.06.020](#rcw23B.06.020) may be, prior, superior, or substantially equal to the shares of the class or series;

(f) Increase the rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution, or the number of authorized shares of any class or series that, after giving effect to the amendment, has rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution that are, or upon designation by the board of directors in accordance with RCW [23B.06.020](#rcw23B.06.020) may be, prior, superior, or substantially equal to the shares of the class or series;

A voting group entitled to vote separately under this section may never comprise a group of holders smaller than the holders of a single class or series authorized and designated as a class or series in the articles of incorporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or unless the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed amendment on a separate vote by one or more smaller voting groups.

(3) If a proposed amendment, that would otherwise entitle two or more classes or series of shares to vote as separate voting groups under this section, would affect those two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, then instead of voting as separate voting groups the shares of all similarly affected classes or series shall vote together as a single voting group on the proposed amendment, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or unless the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed amendment on a separate vote by one or more classes or series.

(4) A class or series of shares is entitled to the voting group rights granted by this section although the articles of incorporation generally describe the shares of the class or series as nonvoting shares. The articles of incorporation may, however, limit or deny the voting group rights granted by subsection (1)(a), (e), or (f) of this section as to any class or series of issued or unissued shares, by means of a provision that makes explicit reference to the limitation or denial of voting group rights that would otherwise apply under subsection (1)(a), (e), or (f) of this section.

(a) Each vote entitled to be cast may be voted for, voted against, or withheld for one or more candidates up to that number of candidates that is equal to the number of directors to be elected but without cumulating the votes, or a shareholder may indicate an abstention for one or more candidates;

(b) To be elected, a candidate must have received the number, percentage, or level of votes specified in the bylaws; provided that holders of shares entitled to vote in the election and constituting a quorum are present at the meeting. Except in a contested election as provided in (e) of this subsection, a candidate who does not receive the number, percentage, or level of votes specified in the bylaws but who was a director at the time of the election shall continue to serve as a director for a term that shall terminate on the date that is the earlier of (i) the date specified in the bylaw, but not longer than ninety days from the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to RCW [23B.07.035](#rcw23B.07.035)(2), or (ii) the date on which an individual is selected by the board of directors to fill the office held by such director, which selection shall be deemed to constitute the filling of a vacancy by the board to which RCW [23B.08.100](#rcw23B.08.100) applies;

(d) The board of directors may select any qualified individual to fill the office held by a director who did not receive the specified vote for election referenced in (b) of this subsection; and

(e) Unless the bylaw specifies otherwise, a bylaw adopted pursuant to this subsection (1) shall not apply to an election of directors by a voting group if (i) at the expiration of the time fixed under a provision requiring advance notification of director candidates, or (ii) absent such a provision, at a time fixed by the board of directors which is not more than fourteen days before notice is given of the meeting at which the election is to occur, there are more candidates for election by the voting group than the number of directors to be elected, one or more of whom are properly proposed by shareholders. An individual shall not be considered a candidate for purposes of this subsection (1)(e) if the board of directors determines before the notice of meeting is given that such individual's candidacy does not create a bona fide election contest.

(2) A bylaw containing an election to be governed by this section may be repealed or amended:

(a) If originally adopted by the shareholders, only by the shareholders, unless the bylaw otherwise provides; or

(b) If adopted by the board of directors, by the board of directors or the shareholders.

(a) If originally adopted by the shareholders, only by the shareholders; or

(1) After adopting a plan of merger or share exchange, the board of directors of each corporation party to the merger, and the board of directors of the corporation whose shares will be acquired in the share exchange, shall submit the plan of merger, except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, or share exchange for approval by its shareholders.

(b) Each shareholder of the surviving corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with identical designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the merger;

### <a name="rcw23B.11.035">RCW 23B.11.035</a>: Plan of merger or share exchange -- Separate voting group.

(1) Except as otherwise required by subsection (3) of this section or otherwise permitted by subsection (4) of this section, the holders of the outstanding shares of a class or series are entitled to vote as a separate voting group on a proposed plan of merger or plan of share exchange if shareholder voting is otherwise required by this title and if, as a result of the proposed plan, holders of part or all of the class or series would hold or receive:

(a) Shares of any class or series of the surviving or acquiring corporation, or of any parent corporation of the surviving corporation, and either (i) that class or series has a greater number of authorized shares than the class or series held by the holders prior to the merger or share exchange, or (ii) the proposed plan effects a change in the number of shares held by the holders, or in the rights, preferences, or limitations of the shares they hold, or in the class or series of shares they hold, and such change adversely affects the holders;

(b) Shares of any class or series of the surviving or acquiring corporation, or of any parent corporation of the surviving corporation, and the holders who hold or receive shares of that class or series are adversely affected under the proposed plan, as compared to their circumstances prior to the proposed merger or share exchange, by the creation, existence, number of authorized shares, or rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution, of another class or series of shares of the surviving, acquiring, or parent corporation having rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution that are, or upon designation by the surviving, acquiring, or parent corporation's board of directors may be, prior, superior, or substantially equal to the shares of the class or series held or to be received by the holders in the proposed merger or share exchange; or

(c) Cash or any other form of consideration other than shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation or of any parent corporation of the surviving corporation, received upon redemption or cancellation of all or part of their shares pursuant to the proposed plan of merger or share exchange.

(2) If a proposed plan of merger or share exchange would affect only a series of a class of shares in one or more of the ways described in subsection (1) of this section, only the shares of that series are entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the proposed plan. A voting group entitled to vote separately under this section may never comprise a group of holders smaller than the holders of a single class or series authorized and designated as a class or series in the articles of incorporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or unless the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed plan on a separate vote by one or more smaller voting groups.

(3) If a proposed plan of merger or share exchange, that would otherwise entitle two or more classes or series of shares to vote as separate voting groups under this section, would affect those two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, then instead of voting as separate voting groups, the shares of all similarly affected classes or series shall vote together as a single voting group on the proposed plan of merger or share exchange, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or unless the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed plan on a separate vote by one or more classes or series. Holders of shares of two or more classes or series of shares who will, under a proposed plan, receive the same type of consideration in the form of shares of the surviving or acquiring corporation or of any parent corporation of the surviving corporation, cash or other form of consideration, or the same combination thereof, but in differing amounts resulting solely from application of provisions in the corporation's articles of incorporation governing distribution of consideration received in a merger or share exchange, are affected in the same or a substantially similar way and are not, by reason of receiving the same types or differing amounts of consideration, entitled to vote as separate voting groups on the proposed plan, unless the articles of incorporation expressly require otherwise or the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed plan on a separate vote by one or more classes or series.

(4) A class or series of shares is entitled to the voting group rights granted by this section although the articles of incorporation generally describe the shares of the class or series as nonvoting shares. The articles of incorporation may, however, limit or deny the voting group rights granted by this section as to any class or series of issued or unissued shares, by means of a provision that makes explicit reference to the limitation or denial of voting group rights that would otherwise apply under this section.



### <a name="rcw23B.11.040">RCW 23B.11.040</a>: Merger of subsidiary.

(1) A parent corporation owning at least ninety percent of the outstanding shares of each class of a subsidiary corporation may merge the subsidiary into itself without approval of the shareholders of the parent or subsidiary.

(a) The names of the parent and subsidiary; and

(b) The manner and basis of converting the shares of the subsidiary into shares, obligations, or other securities of the parent or any other corporation or into cash or other property in whole or part.

(3) Within ten days after the corporate action becomes effective, the parent shall deliver a notice to each shareholder of the subsidiary, which notice shall include a copy of the plan of merger.

(4) Articles of merger under this section may not contain amendments to the articles of incorporation of the parent corporation, except for amendments enumerated in RCW [23B.10.020](#rcw23B.10.020).



### <a name="rcw23B.11.050">RCW 23B.11.050</a>: Articles of merger or share exchange.

(1) Except as provided in RCW [23B.13.270](#rcw23B.13.270), within thirty days of the later of the effective date of the proposed corporate action, or the date the payment demand is received, the corporation shall pay each dissenter who complied with RCW [23B.13.230](#rcw23B.13.230) the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shareholder's shares, plus accrued interest.

(2) The payment must be accompanied by:

(a) The corporation's balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than sixteen months before the date of payment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in shareholders' equity for that year, and the latest available interim financial statements, if any;

(2) If after returning deposited certificates and releasing transfer restrictions, the corporation wishes to effect the proposed corporate action, it must send a new dissenters' notice under RCW [23B.13.220](#rcw23B.13.220) and repeat the payment demand procedure.



### <a name="rcw23B.13.270">RCW 23B.13.270</a>: After-acquired shares.

(1) A corporation may elect to withhold payment required by RCW [23B.13.250](#rcw23B.13.250) from a dissenter unless the dissenter was the beneficial owner of the shares before the date set forth in the dissenters' notice as the date of the first announcement to news media or to shareholders of the terms of the proposed corporate action.

(2) To the extent the corporation elects to withhold payment under subsection (1) of this section, after the effective date of the proposed corporate action, it shall estimate the fair value of the shares, plus accrued interest, and shall pay this amount to each dissenter who agrees to accept it in full satisfaction of the dissenter's demand. The corporation shall send with its offer an explanation of how it estimated the fair value of the shares, an explanation of how the interest was calculated, and a statement of the dissenter's right to demand payment under RCW [23B.13.280](#rcw23B.13.280).



### <a name="rcw23B.13.280">RCW 23B.13.280</a>: Procedure if shareholder dissatisfied with payment or offer.

(1) A dissenter may deliver a notice to the corporation informing the corporation of the dissenter's own estimate of the fair value of the dissenter's shares and amount of interest due, and demand payment of the dissenter's estimate, less any payment under RCW [23B.13.250](#rcw23B.13.250), or reject the corporation's offer under RCW [23B.13.270](#rcw23B.13.270) and demand payment of the dissenter's estimate of the fair value of the dissenter's shares and interest due, if:

(a) The dissenter believes that the amount paid under RCW [23B.13.250](#rcw23B.13.250) or offered under RCW [23B.13.270](#rcw23B.13.270) is less than the fair value of the dissenter's shares or that the interest due is incorrectly calculated;

(b) The corporation fails to make payment under RCW [23B.13.250](#rcw23B.13.250) within sixty days after the date set for demanding payment; or

(c) The corporation does not effect the proposed corporate action and does not return the deposited certificates or release the transfer restrictions imposed on uncertificated shares within sixty days after the date set for demanding payment.

(2) A dissenter waives the right to demand payment under this section unless the dissenter notifies the corporation of the dissenter's demand under subsection (1) of this section within thirty days after the corporation made or offered payment for the dissenter's shares.



### <a name="rcw23B.13.300">RCW 23B.13.300</a>: Court action.

(1) If a demand for payment under RCW [23B.13.280](#rcw23B.13.280) remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding within sixty days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the sixty-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.

(2) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the superior court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the registered office of the domestic corporation merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation was located.

(3) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled, parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.

(4) The corporation may join as a party to the proceeding any shareholder who claims to be a dissenter but who has not, in the opinion of the corporation, complied with the provisions of this chapter. If the court determines that such shareholder has not complied with the provisions of this chapter, the shareholder shall be dismissed as a party.

(5) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (2) of this section is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.

(6) Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment (a) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation, or (b) for the fair value, plus accrued interest, of the dissenter's after-acquired shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under RCW [23B.13.270](#rcw23B.13.270).



### <a name="rcw23B.13.310">RCW 23B.13.310</a>: Court costs and counsel fees.

(1) The court in a proceeding commenced under RCW [23B.13.300](#rcw23B.13.300) shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment under RCW [23B.13.280](#rcw23B.13.280).

(2) The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:

(a) Against the corporation and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of RCW [23B.13.200](#rcw23B.13.200) through [23B.13.280](#rcw23B.13.280); or

(b) Against either the corporation or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by chapter [23B.13](#rcw23B.13) RCW.

(3) If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited.

(2) Unless prohibited by the articles of incorporation, a majority of the board of directors may approve dissolution of the corporation without approval by the shareholders, upon a finding by the board of directors that:

(a) The corporation is not able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or the corporation's assets are less than the sum of its total liabilities; and

(b) Ten or more days have elapsed since the corporation gave notice to all shareholders, whether or not they would otherwise be entitled to vote under RCW [23B.14.020](#rcw23B.14.020), of the intent of the board of directors to approve dissolution under this subsection.

(4) The corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed dissolution either (a) by giving notice of a shareholders' meeting in accordance with RCW [23B.07.050](#rcw23B.07.050) and stating that the purpose or one of the purposes of the meeting is to consider dissolving the corporation, or (b) in accordance with the requirements of RCW [23B.07.040](#rcw23B.07.040) for approving the proposed dissolution without a meeting.

(5) In addition to any other voting conditions imposed by the board of directors under subsection (3) of this section, the proposed dissolution must be approved by two-thirds of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the proposed dissolution, and of each other voting group entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the proposed dissolution.

### <a name="rcw23B.14.030">RCW 23B.14.030</a>: Articles of dissolution -- Publication of notice.

(1) At any time after dissolution is authorized under RCW [23B.14.010](#rcw23B.14.010) or [23B.14.020](#rcw23B.14.020), the corporation may dissolve by delivering to the secretary of state for filing:

The notice must also describe the information that must be included in a claim, provide a mailing address where a claim may be sent, and state that claims against the dissolved corporation may be barred in accordance with the provisions of this chapter if not timely asserted. A dissolved corporation's failure to publish notice in accordance with this subsection does not affect the validity or the effective date of its dissolution.

(4) For purposes of this chapter, "dissolved corporation" means a corporation whose dissolution has been approved in accordance with RCW [23B.14.010](#rcw23B.14.010) or [23B.14.020](#rcw23B.14.020) and whose articles of dissolution have become effective, and includes any trust or other successor entity to which the remaining assets of such a corporation are transferred subject to its liabilities for purposes of liquidation in accordance with RCW [23B.14.050](#rcw23B.14.050).



### <a name="rcw23B.14.040">RCW 23B.14.040</a>: Revocation of dissolution.

(1) A corporation may revoke its dissolution within one hundred twenty days of its effective date.

(2) Revocation of dissolution must be approved in the same manner as the dissolution was approved unless that approval permitted revocation upon approval by the board of directors alone, in which event the board of directors may revoke the dissolution without shareholder approval.

(3) After the revocation of dissolution is approved, the corporation may revoke the dissolution by delivering to the secretary of state for filing articles of revocation of dissolution, together with a copy of its articles of dissolution, that set forth:

(a) The name of the corporation and a statement that such name satisfies the requirements of RCW [23B.04.010](#rcw23B.04.010); if the name is not available, the corporation must file articles of amendment changing its name with the articles of revocation of dissolution;

(b) The effective date of the dissolution that was revoked;

(c) The date that the revocation of dissolution was approved;

(d) If the corporation's board of directors, or incorporators, revoked the dissolution, a statement to that effect;

(f) If shareholder approval was required to revoke the dissolution, a statement that revocation of the dissolution was duly approved by the shareholders in accordance with RCW [23B.14.040](#rcw23B.14.040)(2) [subsection (2) of this section] and [23B.14.020](#rcw23B.14.020).

(4) Revocation of dissolution is effective upon the effective date of the articles of revocation of dissolution.

(5) When the revocation of dissolution is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred.



### <a name="rcw23B.14.050">RCW 23B.14.050</a>: Effect of dissolution.

(1) A dissolved corporation continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that appropriate to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs, including:

(a) Collecting its assets;

(b) Disposing of its properties that will be applied toward satisfaction or making reasonable provision for satisfaction of its liabilities or will otherwise not be distributed in kind to its shareholders, but in any case subject to applicable liens and security interests as well as any applicable contractual restrictions on the disposition of its properties;

(c) Satisfying or making reasonable provision for satisfying its liabilities, in accordance with their priorities as established by law, and on a pro rata basis within each class of liabilities;

(d) Subject to the limitations imposed by RCW [23B.06.400](#rcw23B.06.400), distributing its remaining property among its shareholders according to their interests; and

(e) Doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dissolution of a corporation does not:

(a) Transfer title to the corporation's property;

(b) Prevent transfer of its shares or securities, although the authorization to dissolve may provide for closing the corporation's share transfer records;

(c) Subject its directors or officers to standards of conduct different from those prescribed in chapter [23B.08](#rcw23B.08) RCW;

(d) Change quorum or voting requirements for its board of directors or shareholders; change provisions for selection, resignation, or removal of its directors or officers or both; or change provisions for amending its bylaws;

(e) Prevent commencement of a proceeding by or against the corporation in its corporate name;

(f) Abate or suspend a proceeding pending by or against the corporation on the effective date of dissolution; or

(g) Terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation.

(3) A dissolved corporation's board of directors may make a determination that reasonable provision for the satisfaction of any liability, whether arising in tort or by contract, statute, or otherwise, and whether matured or unmatured, contingent, or conditional, has been made by means of a purchase of insurance coverage, provision of security therefor, contractual assumption thereof by a solvent person, or any other means, that the board of directors determines is reasonably calculated to provide for satisfaction of the reasonably estimated amount of such liability. Upon making such a determination, the board of directors shall, for purposes of determining whether a subsequent distribution to shareholders is prohibited under RCW [23B.06.400](#rcw23B.06.400)(2), be entitled to treat such liability as fully satisfied by the assets used or committed in order to make such provision. In making determinations under RCW [23B.06.400](#rcw23B.06.400)(2), the board of directors of a dissolved corporation may also disregard, and make no provision for the satisfaction of, any liabilities that are barred in accordance with RCW [23B.14.060](#rcw23B.14.060)(2), or that may exceed any provision for their satisfaction ordered by a superior court pursuant to RCW [23B.14.065](#rcw23B.14.065), or that the board of directors does not consider, based on the facts known to it, reasonably likely to arise prior to expiration of the survival period specified in RCW [23B.14.340](#rcw23B.14.340).

(4) The board of directors of a dissolved corporation may at any time petition to have the dissolution continued under court supervision in accordance with RCW [23B.14.300](#rcw23B.14.300), or, upon a finding that the corporation is not able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business or that its assets are less than the sum of its total liabilities, may dedicate the corporation's assets to the repayment of its creditors by making an assignment for the benefit of creditors in accordance with chapter [7.08](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.08) RCW or obtaining the appointment of a general receiver in accordance with chapter [7.60](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.60) RCW. The assumption of control over the corporation's assets by a court, an assignee for the benefit of creditors, or a general receiver relieves the directors of any further duties with respect to the liquidation of the corporation's assets or the application of any assets or proceeds toward satisfaction of its liabilities.

(5) Corporate actions to be approved by a corporation that has been dissolved under RCW [23B.14.030](#rcw23B.14.030) or [23B.14.210](#rcw23B.14.210), which are within the scope of activities permitted in this chapter, may be approved by the corporation's board of directors and, if required, by its shareholders, membership in both groups determined as of the effective date of the dissolution. If vacancies in the board of directors occur after the effective date of dissolution, the shareholders, or the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum of the board, may fill the vacancies. A special meeting of the shareholders for purposes of approving any corporate action required or permitted to be approved by shareholders, or for purposes of electing directors, may be called by any person who was an officer, director, or shareholder of the corporation at the effective date of the dissolution.



### <a name="rcw23B.14.060">RCW 23B.14.060</a>: Known claims against a dissolved corporation.

(1) A dissolved corporation that has published notice of its dissolution in accordance with RCW [23B.14.030](#rcw23B.14.030)(3) may dispose of any or all of the known claims against it by giving written notice of its dissolution to the holders of the known claims at any time after the effective date of dissolution. The written notice of dissolution must:

(a) Provide, for each known claim of the holder to whom the notice is addressed that is sought to be disposed of under this section, either (i) a general description of the known facts specified in subsection (3)(b)(i) or (ii) of this section relating to a matured and legally assertable claim or liability, or (ii) an identification of the executory contract with respect to which unmatured, conditional, or contingent claims or liabilities are sought to be disposed of under this section;

(b) Provide a mailing address where a notice of claim may be sent;

(c) State the deadline, which may not be fewer than one hundred twenty days from the effective date of the written notice of dissolution, by which a written notice of claim must be delivered to the dissolved corporation; 

(d) State that the known claim will be barred if a written notice of claim describing the known claim with reasonable particularity is not delivered to the dissolved corporation by the deadline; and

(e) State that the known claim or any executory contract on which the known claim is based may be rejected by the dissolved corporation, in which case the holder of the known claim will have a limited period of ninety days from the effective date of the rejection notice in which to commence a proceeding to enforce the known claim.

(2) A known claim against the dissolved corporation is barred:

(a) If the holder of the known claim who was given written notice of dissolution under subsection (1) of this section does not deliver the written notice of claim to the dissolved corporation by the deadline; or

(b) If a holder of a known claim that was rejected by the dissolved corporation does not commence a proceeding to enforce the known claim within ninety days from the effective date of the rejection notice.

(3) For purposes of this section, "known claim" means any claim or liability:

(a) That either: (i) Has matured sufficiently, before or after the effective date of the dissolution, to be legally capable of assertion against the dissolved corporation, whether or not the amount of the claim or liability is known or determinable; or (ii) is unmatured, conditional, or otherwise contingent but may subsequently arise under any executory contract to which the dissolved corporation is a party, other than under an implied or statutory warranty as to any product manufactured, sold, distributed, or handled by the dissolved corporation; and

(b) As to which the dissolved corporation has knowledge of the identity and the mailing address of the holder of the claim or liability and, in the case of a matured and legally assertable claim or liability, actual knowledge of existing facts that either (i) could be asserted to give rise to, or (ii) indicate an intention by the holder to assert, such a matured claim or liability.



### <a name="rcw23B.14.065">RCW 23B.14.065</a>: Form and adequacy of satisfaction of claims -- Application to and determination by court.

(1) A dissolved corporation that has published notice of its dissolution in accordance with RCW [23B.14.030](#rcw23B.14.030)(3) may file an application, with the superior court of the county where its principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located, for a determination of:

(a) The amount and form of reasonable provision to be made for the satisfaction of any one or more claims or liabilities, known or unknown, arising in tort or by contract, statute or otherwise, matured or unmatured, contingent or conditional, that have arisen or are reasonably likely to arise prior to expiration of the survival period specified in RCW [23B.14.340](#rcw23B.14.340); or

(b) Whether the provision made or proposed to be made by the board of directors for the satisfaction of any one or more claims or liabilities is reasonable.

Any determination under this subsection is conclusive for purposes of determining the legality of any subsequent distributions under RCW [23B.06.400](#rcw23B.06.400) and [23B.14.050](#rcw23B.14.050)(3).

(2) Within ten days after filing the application, the dissolved corporation shall give written notice of the judicial proceeding to each person to whom written notice has been given pursuant to RCW [23B.14.060](#rcw23B.14.060) and each other person whose claim or potential claim, identity, and mailing address are known to the dissolved corporation. However, written notice of the judicial proceeding need not be given to any person whose claim or potential claim is not sought to be determined under the application filed by the dissolved corporation.

(3) The superior court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all persons whose claims or potential claims are sought to be determined in the judicial proceeding but whose identities or mailing addresses are not known to the dissolved corporation. The reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the dissolved corporation.

(4) Provision by the dissolved corporation for satisfaction of claims or potential claims in the amount and form ordered by the superior court shall satisfy the dissolved corporation's obligations with respect to those claims or potential claims, and any further or greater claims based on the same facts, dealings, or contract shall be barred.



### <a name="rcw23B.14.070">RCW 23B.14.070</a>: Holder of an unpaid claim -- Proceeding against dissolved corporation to collect amount of claim.

(1) The holder of an unpaid claim against a dissolved corporation that is not barred under RCW [23B.14.060](#rcw23B.14.060)(2) or [23B.14.065](#rcw23B.14.065)(4) or by expiration of the survival period specified in RCW [23B.14.340](#rcw23B.14.340) may, within the statute of limitations applicable to the claim, commence a proceeding against the dissolved corporation to collect the amount of the claim from any remaining undistributed assets of the corporation. If the undistributed assets of the corporation are not or may not be sufficient to satisfy the amount of the unpaid claim, and there have been distributions to shareholders as to which the limitations period specified in RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310)(5) has not expired at the time the proceeding is commenced, the holder of the unpaid claim may include as a part of the relief claimed against the dissolved corporation a petition to compel the dissolved corporation to collect any amounts owing to it by directors or shareholders under RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310) and to apply the collections toward payment of the claim. The filing of such a petition to compel the corporation to collect unlawfully distributed amounts from directors or shareholders tolls the limitations periods specified in RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310)(5) and [23B.14.340](#rcw23B.14.340) with respect to the unpaid claim, as to directors and shareholders who may be liable under RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310). If the dissolved corporation fails, within a reasonable period of time after the filing of such a petition to compel it to collect amounts owing under RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310), to join those directors and shareholders who may be liable for the amounts, the holder of the unpaid claim may join those directors and shareholders as additional defendants in the proceeding. The holder of the unpaid claim may also join all directors and shareholders who may be liable under RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310) as additional defendants in the proceeding, at any time upon establishing to the satisfaction of the court that any of such shareholders, with intent to delay or defraud or place property beyond the reach of the corporation's creditors, has removed or is about to remove from this state, or has assigned, secreted, or disposed of, or is about to assign, secrete, or dispose of, any of the property distributed by the corporation as to which the shareholder may be liable under RCW [23B.08.310](#rcw23B.08.310)(3). Except as permitted by this section, the holder of the unpaid claim may not, by means of any proceeding or otherwise, seek to enforce the claim directly against any of the dissolved corporation's officers or directors in those capacities, or against any of its shareholders on account of their receipt of distributions after the effective date of dissolution.

(2) Claims against a dissolved corporation that are barred under RCW [23B.14.060](#rcw23B.14.060)(2) or [23B.14.065](#rcw23B.14.065)(4) or by expiration of the survival period specified in RCW [23B.14.340](#rcw23B.14.340) may not be enforced against the dissolved corporation, any of its officers or directors in those capacities, or any of its shareholders on account of their receipt of distributions after the effective date of dissolution.

### <a name="rcw23B.19.010">RCW 23B.19.010</a>: Legislative findings -- Intent.

The legislature finds that:

(1) Corporations that offer employment and health, retirement, and other benefits to citizens of the state of Washington are vital to the economy of this state and the well-being of all of its citizens;

(2) The welfare of the employees of these corporations is of paramount interest and concern to this state;

(3) Many businesses in this state rely on these corporations to purchase goods and services;

(4) Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held corporations can cause corporate management to dissipate a corporation's assets in an effort to resist the takeover by selling or distributing cash or assets, redeeming stock, or taking other steps to increase the short-term gain to shareholders and to dissipate energies required for strategic planning, market development, capital investment decisions, assessment of technologies, and evaluation of competitive challenges that can damage the long-term interests of shareholders and the economic health of the state by reducing or eliminating the ability to finance investments in research and development, new products, facilities and equipment, and by undermining the planning process for those purposes;

(5) Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control or influence otherwise publicly held corporations are often highly leveraged pursuant to financing arrangements which assume that an acquirer will promptly obtain access to an acquired corporation's cash or assets and use them, or the proceeds of their sale, to repay acquisition indebtedness;

(6) Hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held corporations can harm the economy of the state by weakening corporate performance, and causing unemployment, plant closings, reduced charitable donations, declining population base, reduced income to fee-supported local government services, reduced tax base, and reduced income to other businesses; and

(7) The state has a substantial and legitimate interest in regulating domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that have their most significant business contacts with this state and in regulating hostile or unfriendly attempts to gain control of or influence otherwise publicly held domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that employ a large number of citizens of the state, pay significant taxes, and have a substantial economic base in the state.

The legislature intends this chapter to balance the substantial and legitimate interests of the state in domestic corporations and those foreign corporations that employ a large number of citizens of the state and that have a substantial economic base in the state with: The interests of citizens of other states who own shares of such corporations; the interests of the state of incorporation of such foreign corporations in regulating the internal affairs of corporations incorporated in that state; and the interests of promoting interstate commerce. To this effect, the legislature intends to regulate certain transactions between publicly held corporations and acquiring persons that will tend to harm the long-term health of domestic corporations and of foreign corporations that have their principal executive office and a majority of their assets in this state and that employ a large number of citizens of this state.



### <a name="rcw23B.19.020">RCW 23B.19.020</a>: Definitions.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

(1) "Acquiring person" means a person or group of persons, other than the target corporation or a subsidiary of the target corporation, who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the outstanding voting shares of the target corporation. The term "acquiring person" does not include a person who (a) beneficially owned ten percent or more of the outstanding voting shares of the target corporation on March 23, 1988; (b) acquires its shares by gift, inheritance, or in a transaction in which no consideration is exchanged; (c) exceeds the ten percent threshold as a result of action taken solely by the target corporation, such as redemption of shares, unless that person, by its own action, acquires additional shares of the target corporation; (d) beneficially was the owner of ten percent or more of the outstanding voting shares prior to the time the target corporation had a class of voting shares registered with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section 12 or 15 of the exchange act; or (e) beneficially was the owner of ten percent or more of the outstanding voting shares prior to the time the target corporation amended its articles of incorporation to provide that the corporation shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. An agent, bank, broker, nominee, or trustee for another person, if the other person is not an acquiring person, who acts in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter, is not an acquiring person. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an acquiring person, the number of voting shares of the target corporation that are outstanding shall include shares beneficially owned by the person through application of subsection (4) of this section, but shall not include any other unissued voting shares of the target corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding; or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants, or options; or otherwise.

(2) "Affiliate" means a person who directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, a person.

(3) "Announcement date," when used in reference to any significant business transaction, means the date of the first public announcement of the final, definitive proposal for such a significant business transaction.

(4) "Associate" means (a) a domestic or foreign corporation or organization of which a person is an officer, director, member, or partner or in which a person performs a similar function; (b) a direct or indirect beneficial owner of ten percent or more of any class of equity securities of a person; (c) a trust or estate in which a person has a beneficial interest or as to which a person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (d) the spouse or a parent or sibling of a person or a child, grandchild, sibling, parent, or spouse of any thereof, of a person or an individual having the same home as a person.

(5) "Beneficial ownership," when used with respect to any shares, means ownership by a person:

(a) Who, individually or with or through any of its affiliates or associates, beneficially owns such shares, directly or indirectly; or

(b) Who, individually or with or through any of its affiliates or associates, has (i) the right to acquire the shares, whether the right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise. A person is not the beneficial owner of shares tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by the person or any of the person's affiliates or associates until the tendered shares are accepted for purchase or exchange; or (ii) the right to vote the shares pursuant to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing. A person is not the beneficial owner of any shares under (b)(ii) of this subsection if the agreement, arrangement, or understanding to vote the shares arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations under the exchange act and is not then reportable on schedule 13D under the exchange act, or any comparable or successor report; or

(c) Who has any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or consent as described in (b)(ii) of this subsection, or disposing of the shares with any other person who beneficially owns, or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, the shares.

(6) "Common shares" means any shares other than preferred shares.

(7) "Consummation date," with respect to any significant business transaction, means the date of consummation of such a significant business transaction, or, in the case of a significant business transaction as to which a shareholder vote is taken, the later of the business day prior to the vote or twenty days prior to the date of consummation of such a significant business transaction.

(8) "Control," "controlling," "controlled by," and "under common control with," means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise. A person's beneficial ownership of ten percent or more of a domestic or foreign corporation's outstanding voting shares shall create a rebuttable presumption that such person has control of such corporation. However, a person does not have control of a domestic or foreign corporation if the person holds voting shares, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian, or trustee for one or more beneficial owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such corporation.

(9) "Domestic corporation" means an issuer of voting shares which is organized under chapter [23B.02](#rcw23B.02) RCW or any predecessor provision.

(14) "Shares" means any:

(a) Shares or similar security, any certificate of interest, any participation in any profit sharing agreement, any voting trust certificate, or any certificate of deposit for shares; and

(b) Security convertible, with or without consideration, into shares, or any warrant, call, or other option or privilege of buying shares without being bound to do so, or any other security carrying any right to acquire, subscribe to, or purchase shares.

(15) "Significant business transaction" means:

(a) A merger, share exchange, or consolidation of a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation with (i) an acquiring person, or (ii) any other domestic or foreign corporation which is, or after the merger, share exchange, or consolidation would be, an affiliate or associate of the acquiring person;

(b) A sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, or other disposition or encumbrance, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, to or with an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person of assets of a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation (i) having an aggregate market value equal to five percent or more of the aggregate market value of all the assets, determined on a consolidated basis, of the target corporation, (ii) having an aggregate market value equal to five percent or more of the aggregate market value of all the outstanding shares of the target corporation, or (iii) representing five percent or more of the earning power or net income, determined on a consolidated basis, of the target corporation;

For the purposes of (c) of this subsection, a termination other than an employee's death or disability or bona fide voluntary retirement, transfer, resignation, termination for cause under applicable common law principles, or leave of absence shall be presumed to be a termination resulting from the acquiring person's acquisition of shares, which presumption is rebuttable. A bona fide voluntary transfer of employees between the target corporation and its subsidiaries or between its subsidiaries is not a termination for the purposes of (c) of this subsection;

(d) The issuance, transfer, or redemption by a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, of shares or of options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of a target corporation or a subsidiary of a target corporation to or beneficially owned by an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person except pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights to purchase shares offered, or a dividend, distribution, or redemption paid or made pro rata to, all shareholders or holders of options, warrants, or rights to acquire shares of the target corporation, and except for involuntary redemptions permitted by the target corporation's charter or by the law of this state or the state of incorporation;

(f) A reclassification of securities, including, without limitation, any shares split, shares dividend, or other distribution of shares in respect of stock, or any reverse shares split, or recapitalization of a target corporation, or a merger or consolidation of a target corporation with a subsidiary of the target corporation, or any other transaction, whether or not with or into or otherwise involving an acquiring person, proposed by, or pursuant to an agreement, arrangement, or understanding, whether or not in writing, with an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person, that has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of a class or series of voting shares or securities convertible into voting shares of a target corporation or a subsidiary of the target corporation that is directly or indirectly owned by an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share adjustments; or

(g) A receipt by an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate of an acquiring person of the benefit, directly or indirectly, except proportionately as a shareholder of a target corporation, of loans, advances, guarantees, pledges, or other financial assistance or tax credits or other tax advantages provided by or through a target corporation.

(b) Every foreign corporation required to have a certificate of authority to transact business in this state pursuant to chapter [23B.15](#rcw23B.15) RCW, if:

If a shareholder record date has not been fixed by the board of directors within the preceding four months, the determination shall be made as of the end of the corporation's most recent fiscal quarter.

The residence of each shareholder is presumed to be the address appearing in the records of the corporation. Shares held of record by brokers or nominees shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the percentages and numbers specified in this subsection.

A domestic or foreign corporation shall be deemed to be a target corporation if the domestic or foreign corporation's failure to satisfy the requirements of this subsection is caused by the action of, or is the result of a proposal by, an acquiring person or affiliate or associate of an acquiring person.

(20) "Voting shares" means shares of a corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.



### <a name="rcw23B.19.030">RCW 23B.19.030</a>: Transaction excluded from chapter -- Inadvertent acquisition.

### <a name="rcw23B.19.040">RCW 23B.19.040</a>: Approval of significant business transaction required -- Violation.

(b) If a good faith proposal for a significant business transaction is made in writing to the board of directors of the target corporation prior to the significant business transaction or prior to the share acquisition time, the board of directors shall respond in writing, within thirty days or such shorter period, if any, as may be required by the exchange act setting forth its reasons for its decision regarding the proposal. If a good faith proposal to purchase shares is made in writing to the board of directors of the target corporation, the board of directors, unless it responds affirmatively in writing within thirty days or a shorter period, if any, as may be required by the exchange act shall be deemed to have disapproved such share purchase.

(2) Except for a significant business transaction approved under subsection (1) of this section or exempted by RCW [23B.19.030](#rcw23B.19.030), in addition to any other requirement, a target corporation shall not engage at any time in any significant business transaction described in RCW [23B.19.020](#rcw23B.19.020)(15) (a) or (e) with any acquiring person of such a corporation other than a significant business transaction that either meets all of the conditions of (a), (b), and (c) of this subsection or meets the conditions of (d) of this subsection:

(ii) The market value per share of common shares on the announcement date with respect to a significant business transaction or on the date of the acquiring person's share acquisition time, whichever is higher; plus interest compounded annually from such a date through the consummation date at the rate for one-year United States treasury obligations from time to time in effect; less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the market value of any dividends paid other than in cash, per share of common shares since the date, up to the amount of the interest.

(b) The aggregate amount of the cash and the market value as of the consummation date of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of outstanding shares of any class or series of shares, other than common shares, of the target corporation is at least equal to the highest of the following, whether or not the acquiring person has previously acquired any shares of such a class or series of shares:
